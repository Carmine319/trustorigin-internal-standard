# TrustOrigin Internal Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the mandatory principles governing the operation of the
TrustOrigin registry.

The registry exists to record the **existence** of artefacts, declarations,
and system events at a specific point in time.

It does not evaluate, verify, or adjudicate.

---

## 2. Non-Claims Principle

The registry SHALL NOT:

- assert truth or falsity
- verify authenticity or originality
- certify ownership or authorship
- imply legal, regulatory, or evidentiary status
- assess compliance or admissibility

All records are neutral acknowledgements of existence only.

---

## 3. Registry Outputs

The registry MAY issue system-generated acknowledgements (“Trust Receipts”)
confirming that a registry entry was recorded at a given time.

Trust Receipts do not constitute evidence.

---

## 4. Governance Boundary

The registry SHALL maintain strict separation between:

- record preservation
- interpretation
- adjudication

Interpretation and judgement occur outside the registry.

---

## 5. Applicability

This standard applies across domains including but not limited to:

- synthetic media
- construction records
- academic artefacts
- digital media rights
- procurement documentation

---

## 6. Status of the Standard

This standard is normative for TrustOrigin registry operations.
It does not impose obligations on third parties.
