## What This Repository Is

This repository publishes the **authoritative Internal Standard and governance artefacts**
governing the operation of **TrustOrigin**, a neutral technical registry infrastructure
designed to preserve:

- the **existence** of artefacts or declarations,
- the **time** at which they existed, and
- the **continuity of custody** across defined events.

The material in this repository defines **governance constraints**, **non-claims
boundaries**, and **operational posture**.  
It does **not** publish software, APIs, SDKs, executable systems, or implementation code.

This repository exists to enable **public scrutiny, institutional evaluation,
procurement review, and formal citation**.

## Public Sector & Procurement Positioning (UK)

This repository is published to support **UK public-sector, academic, and regulated-sector**
evaluation of TrustOrigin as neutral technical infrastructure.

TrustOrigin is intentionally structured to align with UK procurement and governance
principles, including:

- separation of duties and authority  
- non-delegation of statutory responsibility  
- supplier neutrality  
- auditability without advisory overreach  
- clear accountability boundaries  

Nothing in this repository constitutes:

- a managed service,
- a professional advisory engagement,
- a compliance determination,
- a certification scheme,
- or a delegation of regulatory responsibility.

All decision-making authority, compliance assessment, and legal interpretation remain
solely with the contracting authority and its appointed professional advisers.

## Not a SaaS Platform (Procurement Clarification)

TrustOrigin is **not a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product**.

In particular:

- there is no self-serve onboarding;
- there is no feature marketplace;
- there is no outcome-based or usage-based pricing;
- there are no performance guarantees;
- there is no automation by default.

TrustOrigin is licensed as **infrastructure**, not consumed as a software service.

This distinction exists to:

- avoid reliance risk,
- prevent supplier-induced outcomes,
- preserve evidentiary neutrality,
- reduce procurement, audit, and liability exposure.

## What TrustOrigin Is

TrustOrigin is:

- a **neutral registry infrastructure**;
- a **technical recording layer**, not an interpretive system;
- a **time-anchored evidence substrate**;
- designed to operate **beneath** legal, academic, regulatory, and governance processes.

TrustOrigin records *that something existed at a specific point in time*, not *what it means*.

---

## What TrustOrigin Is Not

TrustOrigin is **not**:

- a SaaS platform or software product;
- a compliance, certification, or audit service;
- a legal, regulatory, or supervisory authority;
- a decision-making, scoring, or adjudicative system.

It does not verify, validate, certify, judge, rank, or assess artefacts, declarations,
or parties.

---

## Governance & Non-Claims Architecture

All TrustOrigin operations are constrained by a formal **non-claims architecture**.

The infrastructure does **not** claim to determine:

- truth or falsity;
- authenticity or originality;
- ownership or authorship;
- legality or compliance;
- admissibility or evidentiary weight.

All interpretation is **explicitly externalised** to competent authorities.

This posture is structural, contractual, and procedural—not discretionary.

---

## Use Across Domains (Vertical-Agnostic)

The same neutral registry core may be used across multiple domains, including:

- synthetic media and AI-assisted content;
- music and audio works;
- gaming and interactive assets;
- research and academic outputs;
- publication and archival materials;
- construction, litigation, and dispute readiness;
- escrow-like declarative workflows.

Domain-specific usage does **not** alter evidentiary meaning, authority, or governance posture.

---

## Interpretation for Audit & Assurance Committees

For audit, risk, and assurance purposes:

- TrustOrigin **records existence and custody only**;
- TrustOrigin **does not express opinions**;
- TrustOrigin **does not certify compliance**;
- TrustOrigin **does not influence outcomes**.

Any reliance placed upon TrustOrigin records is a matter for the relying authority,
assessed under its own governance, legal advice, and statutory framework.

---
